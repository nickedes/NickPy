# Goodreads-Quotes

Scrapes all the quotes from a goodreads user's list.

This can be done by two different methods:

1. `greads.py`
 > Scrapes all the pages of the user's liked list by using HTML scraper and is added to a file.

2. `greads_rss.py`
 > Scrapes the rss feed of the user's liked quotes and then randomly displays anyone quote from all the quotes.

Usage:

You can see the quote being displayed [here](http://trigonaminima.github.io/) uses `greads_rss.py` to generate a random quote.
